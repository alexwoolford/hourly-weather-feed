# hourly-weather-feed

NOAA has an FTP site that published hourly weather data. This historic data goes back to year 2000, and contains measurements from a number of stations across the United States.

This Spring application grabs that data from the FTP site, and writes it to a MySQL database. The intention of this project was to make it easy for analysts to rapidly acquire a self-updating weather dataset that spans a long period of time.
